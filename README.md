# YouTube to Spotify Playlist Transfer

This project allows you to transfer playlists from YouTube Music to Spotify. By using the YouTube Music API and Spotify API, the application retrieves a playlist from a YouTube Music account, searches for the songs on Spotify, retrieves their Spotify IDs, creates a new playlist on Spotify, and adds the songs to this new playlist.
